# Overview


## HTTP verbs

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.


Verb     | Usage
-------- | -----
`GET`    | Used to retrieve a resource
`POST`   | Used to create a new resource
`PATCH`  | Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates
`DELETE` | Used to delete an existing resource

## HTTP status codes

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

Status code       | Usage
----------------- | -----
`200 OK`          | The request completed successfully
`201 Created`     | A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's `Location` header
`204 No Content`  | An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully
`400 Bad Request` | The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information
`404 Not Found`   | The requested resource did not exist

## Errors

<%= ERB.new(File.read("../target/generated-snippets/error-example/http-response.md")).result(binding) %>

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

<%= ERB.new(File.read("../target/generated-snippets/error-example/response-fields.md")).result(binding) %>

## Hypermedia

RESTful Notes uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in [Hypertext Application Language (HAL)](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html format).
Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should not create URIs
themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate



# Resources



## Index

<%= ERB.new(File.read("../target/generated-snippets/index-example/curl-request.md")).result(binding) %>
<%= ERB.new(File.read("../target/generated-snippets/index-example/http-request.md")).result(binding) %>
<%= ERB.new(File.read("../target/generated-snippets/index-example/http-response.md")).result(binding) %>

The index provides the entry point into the service. A `GET` request is used to access the index.

### Response structure

<%= ERB.new(File.read("../target/generated-snippets/index-example/response-fields.md")).result(binding) %>

### Links
